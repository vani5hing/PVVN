## Bin Overviews

So these are just some pages that give a brief overview of some of the pieces of the heap we will need to understand. This is the recommended order for going through these:

- [basic_heap](basic_heap.md) (done)
- [tcache](tcache.md) (done)
- [fastbin](fastbin.md) (done)
- [bins](bins.md) (done)
- [unsorted_bin](unsorted_bin.md) (done)
- [small_bins](small_bins.md) (done)
- [large_bins](large_bins.md) (done) (this is dope, must read carefully)
- [main_arena](main_arena.md) (done)
