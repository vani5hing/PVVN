Note và thử nghiệm trong quá trình học `fsop` (mostly `glibc 2.35` and `2.38` and `2.39`).

> I do not try by any means to get credit of the docs, AS I LEARN AND NOTE/ANNOTATE FROM THEM , all credits go to authors of their blogs (which I also linked into each note).

Some interesting blog/link (I'll read if I have time):
